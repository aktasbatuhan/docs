Dria orchestrates a global network of devices, turning idle silicon into a distributed AI super-fabric capable of running powerful multimodal models beyond the reach of individual devices. Every payment, proof, reward, and penalty is transparently settled on Solana using the `$DRIA` token.

Our tokenomics are designed around a simple yet powerful principle:

> **Trade idle compute directly for inference, securing immediate, frictionless access to advanced multimodal AI.**

This creates a virtuous cycle where nodes provide compute, earn tokens, and reinvest those tokens directly into accessing the powerful AI models they help run. As a result, token value remains locked within the ecosystem, preventing inflationary pressures and ensuring deep retention and aligned incentives.

### Why the Model Works
* **Compute-to-AGI Access**: Trade idle compute directly for inference, securing immediate, free access to multimodal, AGI-grade models beyond the capabilities of individual devices.
* **Enforcing Ownership and Creating Deeper Retention**: Reinforcing a virtuous cycle where nodes provide compute, earn tokens, and reinvest directly to access large-scale, multimodal systems.
* **Verifiable Compute**: Nodes commit lightweight TOPLOC proofs; faulty computations are penalized, honest ones rewarded.
* **Dual On-Ramps & Deflation**: Enterprises pay in USD/USDC or `$DRIA`. USD payments buy back `$DRIA` from the market, which is then burned. All payments convert into locked credits usable only for inference.
* **Compute-Linked Emission**: New tokens are minted only when verified compute is delivered, directly linking token supply growth to real economic output.
* **Capped & Aggressively Deflationary**: Total supply is fixed. `$DRIA` tokens are burned through USD credit purchases, on-prem conversions, and oracle usage, compressing circulating supply as adoption grows.

## Economic Flywheel

**Self-reinforcing loop:**  
Inference usage locks revenue → burns supply → boosts token value → attracts more compute providers → reduces inference costs → drives further usage.

## At a Glance

| Pillar                 | What Happens                                                                 | Why It Matters                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention**          | Payments convert to non-withdrawable credits. USD payments buy & burn `$DRIA`. | Value stays locked for inference, actively reducing circulating supply.              |
| **Emission**           | Rewards released only after verified compute delivery.                       | Supply growth directly tied to real economic output, not speculation.               |
| **Deflation**          | `$DRIA` burned on USD credit purchases, on-prem conversions, & oracle usage. | Aggressively shrinks circulating supply as adoption increases.                      |
| **Staking & Slashing** | Nodes lock collateral; faulty computations penalized.                        | Ensures network reliability without trusted intermediaries.                         |
| **Solana Settlement**  | Sub-second finality, minimal fees.                                           | Enables efficient on-chain scheduling and micro-rewards.                            |

Dria's tokenomics convert **electricity + spare silicon** into a globally auditable AI utility:

* **Sustainable**: Capped supply, compute-linked emissions.
* **Aligned**: Enterprises, developers, and hardware owners all benefit from network growth.
* **Trustless**: Every inference task is cryptographically verifiable.
* **Composable**: Built natively on Solana, ready to integrate with any DePIN or AI stack.
