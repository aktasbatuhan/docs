## Node Runner Incentives & Staking

This page outlines how Dria incentivizes node runners through compute-based rewards and staking yields, crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable decentralized AI compute network.

### **A. Compute-Based Rewards**
- Node runners supply compute (FLOPS) to the network.
- The protocol pays rewards proportional to verified compute, from the emissions schedule.
- **For verifiable inference tasks:** The protocol only rewards nodes whose computations pass verification.
- Formula: `Reward = FLOPS_delivered * Reward_Rate` (The `Reward_Rate` varies based on network demand and the disinflationary schedule, targeting approximately [X-Y] `$DRIA` per million FLOPS).

### **B. Staking Yield**
- Node runners must stake `$DRIA` tokens to participate.
- Active nodes (meeting uptime targets) earn additional yield on their staked tokens.
- Formula: `Yield = Tokens_staked * Yield_Rate * Active_Hours` (targeting annual yields of [10-90%] based on network conditions and node reliability).
- Total earnings = Compute rewards + Staking yield.

### **C. Staking Parameters (Placeholders)**
- **Minimum Stake:** To participate, node runners must stake a minimum of [e.g., 100] `$DRIA` per active node. This baseline stake signifies commitment to the network.
- **Device Eligibility:** Any device capable of contributing verifiable FLOPS and meeting the network's operational standards is eligible to be staked by its operator.
- **Unstaking Period:** To maintain network stability, the protocol enforces a [e.g., 7-day] cooldown period when unstaking `$DRIA` tokens. During this cooldown, tokens earn no yield and remain untransferable. After cooldown, tokens become fully liquid.
- **Collateral Custody (Program-Controlled Escrow):** The protocol holds all staked `$DRIA` tokens in a program-controlled escrow smart contract on Solana. This means neither Dria nor any third party can access or move your collateralâ€”only the contract's logic (e.g., for slashing, reward distribution, or unstaking) can release funds. This ensures maximum security, transparency, and trust for all network participants.

**Slashing:**
The protocol slashes staked `$DRIA` to disincentivize malicious behavior, prolonged downtime, or service failures. For verifiable inference tasks, the protocol slashes nodes that fail verification by approximately [5-20%] of their stake. This mechanism ensures the integrity of the network. Specific slashing triggers and percentages appear in operational guidelines.

#### Example: Node Runner Reward Calculation

Suppose:
- Node delivers **10,000,000 FLOPS** for a task
- **Reward Rate** = 0.0001 `$DRIA` per FLOP
- **Staked Amount** = 1,000 `$DRIA`
- **Yield Rate** = 0.01% per hour
- **Active Hours** = 100 hours

**Compute Reward:**

    10,000,000 FLOPS * 0.0001 `$DRIA`/FLOP = 1,000 `$DRIA`

**Staking Yield:**

    1,000 `$DRIA` * 0.0001 * 100 = 10 `$DRIA`

**Total Earnings:**

    1,000 `$DRIA` (compute) + 10 `$DRIA` (yield) = 1,010 `$DRIA`

#### Concrete Example: Staking APR Calculation

Suppose you stake 1,000 `$DRIA` for one year. If the staking yield rate is 0.01% per hour and your node is active 100% of the time (8,760 hours/year):

    Annual Staking Yield = 1,000 `$DRIA` * 0.0001 * 8,760 = 876 `$DRIA`

    Staking APR = (876 / 1,000) * 100% = 87.6%

If your node is only active 50% of the time, your APR would be half that (43.8%). This allows you to sanity-check the impact of uptime and rate on your staking returns.
