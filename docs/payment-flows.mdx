## Payment Flows: Dual On-Ramps

Dria supports two primary payment flows for enterprise and developer users:

### **A. USD / Fiat / Stablecoin Payments**
- **Process:**
    1. Users pay in USD (or stablecoins like USDC).
    2. Dria manages a dedicated wallet for each customer.
    3. The system deducts a small conversion fee (~1-2%).
    4. At regular intervals (daily/weekly), the protocol converts the net USD to `$DRIA` tokens at the current market rate.
    5. These convert to **locked credits** in the user's account (non-withdrawable).
    6. All network activity consumes these locked credits.

### **B. Direct `$DRIA` Token Payments**
- **Process:**
    1. Users pay directly with `$DRIA` tokens from their wallets.
    2. The protocol converts 100% of these tokens to locked credits with no fee.
    3. Credits become immediately available for network usage.

**Unified Credit System:**
All payments (fiat or crypto) become locked credits that users can only spend on network services, ensuring revenue retention within the ecosystem.
