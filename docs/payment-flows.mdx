title: Payment Flows for Model Access
description: How Dria's dual payment on-ramps enable trading compute for inference and ensure value retention within the ecosystem.

## Payment Flows: Value Retention By Design

Dria supports two primary payment flows, both designed to lock value within the ecosystem and support the core model of trading compute for inference:

### **A. USD / Fiat / Stablecoin Payments**
- **Process:**
    1. Users pay in USD (or stablecoins like USDC) to access advanced model inference.
    2. Dria manages a dedicated wallet for each customer.
    3. After deducting a small processing fee (~1-2%), Dria uses the net USD amount to purchase `$DRIA` tokens from the open market at the prevailing rate (e.g., daily TWAP).
    4. **These purchased `$DRIA` tokens are immediately burned**, permanently reducing the total circulating supply.
    5. An equivalent value in **locked credits** (non-withdrawable) is allocated to the user's account specifically for model inference.
    6. All model inference and service consumption by the user then draws from these locked credits.

### **B. Direct `$DRIA` Token Payments**
1. Users pay directly with `$DRIA` tokens from their wallets to access multimodal inference.
2. The protocol converts 100% of these tokens to locked credits with no fee.
3. Credits become immediately available for model inference on the network.

**Unified Credit System and Value Retention:**
All payments (fiat or crypto) become locked credits that users can only spend on inference services. This mechanism is central to Dria's value proposition - it ensures that value remains within the ecosystem, creating continuous demand for the token and counterbalancing the emission of new tokens to compute providers.

### **C. Oracle Node Service Payments**
Users accessing Dria's Oracle Node services follow a specific payment flow:

1.  **Direct `$DRIA` Payment for Services:**
    *   Payment for Oracle Node services is made directly using `$DRIA` tokens (denoted as TokensoracleTokensoracleTokens_{oracle}).
2.  **Immediate Conversion to Prepaid Credits:**
    *   These `$DRIA` tokens are instantly converted into prepaid `$DRIA` credits within the user's account.
    *   Each request made to an Oracle Node then consumes a predetermined amount of these credits (CoracleCoracleC_{oracle}).
3.  **SDK-Based Service Access:**
    *   Interaction with Oracle Nodes is facilitated through a lightweight SDK, which sends requests directly to the nodes. This provides a direct interface without a full-featured UI or advanced analytics.
4.  **Ecosystem Token Recirculation:**
    *   Similar to other payment flows, the `$DRIA` tokens collected from Oracle Node service usage are channeled into the ecosystem's treasury. These funds contribute to supporting node runner rewards and overall network health.

## The Virtuous Cycle in Action

These payment mechanisms create a virtuous cycle:

1. **Value Enters** - Through USD/fiat payments that buy and burn `$DRIA`, increasing scarcity.
2. **Value Remains Locked** - As all payments convert to non-withdrawable credits for inference.
3. **Compute Providers Earn** - By contributing resources to the network.
4. **Earned Value Recirculates** - As providers reinvest their earned tokens to access inference themselves.

This closed-loop system enables the "trade idle compute for inference" model that defines Dria's approach, creating natural deflationary pressure and ensuring deep retention of value within the ecosystem.
