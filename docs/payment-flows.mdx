## Payment Flows: Dual On-Ramps

Dria supports two primary payment flows for enterprise and developer users:

### **A. USD / Fiat / Stablecoin Payments**
- **Process:**
    1. Users pay in USD (or stablecoins like USDC).
    2. Dria manages a dedicated wallet for each customer.
    3. The system deducts a small conversion fee (~1-2%).
    4. At regular intervals (daily/weekly), the protocol converts the net USD to `$DRIA` tokens at the current market rate.
    5. These convert to **locked credits** in the user's account (non-withdrawable).
    6. All network activity consumes these locked credits.

### **B. Direct `$DRIA` Token Payments**
- **Process:**
    1. Users pay directly with `$DRIA` tokens from their wallets.
    2. The protocol converts 100% of these tokens to locked credits with no fee.
    3. Credits become immediately available for network usage.

**Unified Credit System:**
All payments (fiat or crypto) become locked credits that users can only spend on network services, ensuring revenue retention within the ecosystem.

### **C. Oracle Node Service Payments**
Users accessing Dria's Oracle Node services follow a specific payment flow:

1.  **Direct `$DRIA` Payment for Services:**
    *   Payment for Oracle Node services is made directly using `$DRIA` tokens (denoted as TokensoracleTokensoracleTokens_{oracle}).
2.  **Immediate Conversion to Prepaid Credits:**
    *   These `$DRIA` tokens are instantly converted into prepaid `$DRIA` credits within the user's account.
    *   Each request made to an Oracle Node then consumes a predetermined amount of these credits (CoracleCoracleC_{oracle}).
3.  **SDK-Based Service Access:**
    *   Interaction with Oracle Nodes is facilitated through a lightweight SDK, which sends requests directly to the nodes. This provides a direct interface without a full-featured UI or advanced analytics.
4.  **Ecosystem Token Recirculation:**
    *   Similar to other payment flows, the `$DRIA` tokens collected from Oracle Node service usage are channeled into the ecosystem's treasury. These funds contribute to supporting node runner rewards and overall network health.
