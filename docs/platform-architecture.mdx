## Solana: The onchain Settlement Layer

Dria leverages Solana for:
- **High-throughput settlement** – The protocol processes all payments, assignments, and rewards at sub-second speeds with predictable low fees (~$0.0005 per transaction).
- **onchain scheduling** – Smart contracts match jobs to nodes, escrow payments, and issue work vouchers within the same block (400ms).
- **Verifiable inference** – The protocol validates all compute through onchain commitments, with TOPLOC proofs enabling efficient verification without costly zero-knowledge overhead.
- **Composability** – All token flows operate in a single, programmable environment, allowing seamless interaction with the broader Solana ecosystem.

## Usage Modes

### **A. Network Usage**
- Users consume credits for compute on the Dria network.
- If paying with USD/Fiat: Dria uses the fiat to buy `$DRIA` from the market, burns these tokens, and issues equivalent credits to the user. This is a deflationary event.
- If paying with `$DRIA`: Tokens are directly converted to locked credits.
- All requests are paid from these prepaid credits.

### **B. On-Prem Usage**
- Enterprises can run Dria's compiler on their own infrastructure.
- They typically prepay for credits in USD. This transaction follows the same buy-and-burn mechanism: Dria uses the USD to purchase `$DRIA` from the market, these tokens are burned, and the enterprise receives an equivalent value in locked credits.
- Idle compute contributed back to the Dria network earns `$DRIA`. These earned tokens can then be converted back into platform credits (which may also involve a burn of the earned tokens), further reducing operational costs and contributing to deflation.

### **C. Oracle Node Usage**
- Lightweight SDK allows direct `$DRIA` payments for Oracle Node services.
- These `$DRIA` tokens are converted to credits. Each request consumes credits, and a portion of the underlying `$DRIA` is burned, supporting deflation.
