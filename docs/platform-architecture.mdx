## Platform Architecture & Usage Modes

This document covers the foundational elements of Dria's platform, including its reliance on the Solana blockchain for efficient operations and the different ways users can interact with the network.

## Solana: The onchain Settlement Layer

Dria leverages Solana for:
- **High-throughput settlement** – The protocol processes all payments, assignments, and rewards at sub-second speeds with predictable low fees (~$0.0005 per transaction).
- **onchain scheduling** – Smart contracts match jobs to nodes, escrow payments, and issue work vouchers within the same block (400ms).
- **Verifiable inference** – The protocol validates all compute through onchain commitments, with TOPLOC proofs enabling efficient verification without costly zero-knowledge overhead.
- **Composability** – All token flows operate in a single, programmable environment, allowing seamless interaction with the broader Solana ecosystem.

## Usage Modes

### **A. Network Usage**
- Users consume credits for compute on the Dria network.
- All requests are paid from prepaid credits.

### **B. On-Prem Usage**
- Enterprises can run Dria's compiler on their own infrastructure.
- They prepay for credits in USD, which are converted to `$DRIA` and locked.
- Idle compute contributed to the network earns `$DRIA`, which can be burned for credits (deflationary).

### **C. Oracle Node Usage**
- Lightweight SDK allows direct `$DRIA` payments for Oracle Node services.
- Each request consumes credits; tokens are burned, supporting deflation.
