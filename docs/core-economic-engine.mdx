## Core Economic Engine

This section explains the fundamental economic drivers of the Dria network, focusing on how value is retained, how token supply is managed through inflation, and how deflationary pressures are introduced.

### **Retention** – *value stays in the ecosystem*
The protocol locks all payments as non-withdrawable credits, which users can only spend on network services. This creates continuous demand and value retention.

### **Inflation** – *supply grows only after compute delivered*
- The protocol mints new `$DRIA` tokens only as rewards for node runners from the "Node Runner Rewards Pool" allocation, after verifying their compute delivery (measured in FLOPS).
- **Emission Period:** Rewards distribute over [e.g., 10 years], ensuring sustainable network growth.
- **Disinflationary Model:** Annual emissions decrease from [~8-10%] in early years to [~1-2%] in later years. This controlled approach manages inflation while consistently rewarding node participation.

#### Example: Emission Schedule Table (Placeholders)

| Year | Annual Emission (%) | Tokens Emitted (Example) | Cumulative Emitted |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 10%                 | 35,000,000               | 35,000,000         |
| 2    | 8%                  | 28,000,000               | 63,000,000         |
| 3    | 6%                  | 21,000,000               | 84,000,000         |
| 4    | 4%                  | 14,000,000               | 98,000,000         |
| 5-10 | 2%/yr               | 7,000,000/yr             | 140,000,000        |

*This table is for illustration. Actual schedule will be finalized before TGE.*

**Example Scenario: Inflation Schedule**

Suppose the Node Runner Rewards Pool starts with 35% of a 1,000,000,000 `$DRIA` supply (i.e., 350,000,000 `$DRIA`). In Year 1, the protocol emits 10% of this pool (35,000,000 `$DRIA`) as rewards. In Year 2, it emits 8% (28,000,000 `$DRIA`), and so on, following the table above. This means the emission rate slows over time, making `$DRIA` scarcer as the network matures.

### **Deflation** – *token burns reduce supply*
- **USD-to-Credit Purchases**: When users purchase platform credits using USD or fiat-equivalent stablecoins, Dria utilizes these funds to buy `$DRIA` tokens from the open market. These acquired `$DRIA` tokens are then immediately and verifiably burned, directly reducing the total circulating supply. This serves as a primary deflationary mechanism tied to platform adoption via fiat on-ramps.
- When on-prem users convert `$DRIA` tokens *earned* from contributing idle compute back into platform credits, a portion of these earned tokens can also be burned, further contributing to supply reduction.
- Accessing Oracle Node services, which involves users paying directly in `$DRIA` tokens (via an SDK) that are then converted to prepaid credits, also contributes to deflation; as these credits are consumed for Oracle requests, approximately 0.5-1% of the initially paid `$DRIA` tokens are burned, thereby being removed from circulation and supporting ongoing deflation.

**Concrete Example: Burn Mechanism**

When an on-prem customer earns 10,000 `$DRIA` from contributing idle compute and converts them to platform credits, the protocol burns these tokens. This removes 10,000 `$DRIA` from circulation (~0.001% of total supply in our example), contributing to long-term deflationary pressure and supporting token value.
