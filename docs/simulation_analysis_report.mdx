## Tokenomics Models Analyzed

### Model 1: Sim1

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion DRIA tokens
- **Rewards Pool**: 35% (350M tokens)
- **Emission Mechanism**: Utility-driven with deflationary burns
- **Price Discovery**: Supply/demand equilibrium with burn mechanisms

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
Emission Rate: E_t = f(network_utilization, demand_growth)
Burn Rate: B_t = USD_purchases / current_price + service_fees
Net Supply: S_t+1 = S_t + E_t - B_t
```

### Model 2: Sim2 (Bittensor-Inspired)

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Total Supply**: 100 million DRIA tokens  
- **Emission Schedule**: Bitcoin-like halving every 4 years
- **Governance**: Performance-based validator rewards
- **Treasury**: Dynamic fund management

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
Epoch Reward: R_epoch = base_reward / (2^halvings)
Validator Share: V_share = performance_score × total_rewards
Treasury Flow: T_flow = emissions × treasury_rate - outflows
```

<Note>
**Design Inspiration**: This model draws from Bittensor's innovative approach to decentralized AI incentive mechanisms, adapting their performance-based reward distribution and halving schedule for DePIN applications.
</Note>

### Model 3: Sim3 (BME-Inspired)

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion DRIA tokens
- **Adaptive Emissions**: Market-responsive supply adjustments
- **BME Mechanism**: Dynamic burn/mint equilibrium
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time supply/demand balancing

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
Supply Pressure: P_supply = (emissions - burns) / circulating_supply
Demand Pressure: P_demand = growth_rate × trend_impact
Price Update: price_t+1 = price_t × (1 + P_demand - P_supply × 0.1)
```

<Note>
**Design Inspiration**: This model implements the Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium (BME) mechanism as analyzed in Volt Capital's optimal control theory research for DePIN protocols, providing dynamic supply adjustment based on real demand signals.
